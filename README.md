## Summary
  
The election commission can utilize the script created for this audit analysis for other elections as well for any number of county, candidate, and vote count datasets. If the election commission is interested in analyzing a wider range of voter demographic with a more comprehensive dataset, the script writtent to read, analyze, and print for the current dataset can be altered to desired categories. Demographic data such as cty, age, race, gender, ethnicity, income, education, employment, and marital status can be included into the dataset to be analyzed. For example, statistical analysis can be performed on the voter demographics per candidate or county.
